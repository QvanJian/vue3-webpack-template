# vue3-webpack-template

A self made template with both webpack and vue3. Just can run, may be terrible.

#

Is't almost a empty template. And I'm not sure about the babel configuration, and may rewrite later.

For my preference, I use the `postcss-inline-svg` . However, One of its dependencies, `css-what@4.x` , can be vulnerable. So uninstall it, if ok.

Vue3.x isn't ready perfectly for just with webpack yet. It may contain problems itself.
